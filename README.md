# NUSConnect

NUSConnect is a prototype website, we created as part of our Orbital Project, meant to help students create new relationships, based on shared interests, and to help students find a fellow peer volunteer tutor for academic help.

Features implemented:
1. Account registration
2. Logging in and logging out
3. Profile creation(Users can also edit their profile)
4. Post creation
5. Search for friendds based on interest
6. Search for peer volunteer tutor based on module code
7. Creation (and deletion) of self-reminders
8. Chat with potential tutor/friend
