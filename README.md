# NUSConnect

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

NUSConnect is a prototype website, we created as part of our Orbital Project, meant to help students create new relationships, based on shared interests, and to help students find a fellow peer volunteer tutor for academic help.

Features implemented:
1. Account registration
2. Logging in and logging out
3. Profile creation(Users can also edit their profile)
4. Post creation
5. Search for friendds based on interest
6. Search for peer volunteer tutor based on module code
7. Creation (and deletion) of self-reminders
8. Chat with potential tutor/friend
